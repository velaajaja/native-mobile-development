# My Project

This project consists of a series of exercises organized through a menu that allows access to three main categories: **Operators**, **Conditionals**, and **Loops**. Each category contains a variety of exercises that users can perform to practice and familiarize themselves with different programming concepts.

## Main Menu

When executing the program, a main menu is displayed with the following options:

1. **Operators**
2. **Conditionals**
3. **Loops**
4. **Exit**

## Categories

### Operators

In the **Operators** category, users can find exercises involving basic mathematical calculations, currency conversions, areas and perimeters of geometric figures, among others.

### Conditionals

The **Conditionals** category presents exercises that require making decisions based on conditions. Users can practice verifying if a number is positive, negative, or zero, finding the greater or lesser of several numbers, calculating quotients, among other tasks.

### Loops

The **Loops** category offers exercises related to loops and repetitions. Users can practice printing even or odd numbers, summing squares of numbers, generating number sequences, among others.

## Instructions for Use

1. Run the program, and you will see the **Main Menu**.
2. Choose the category you prefer: **Operators**, **Conditionals**, or **Loops**.
3. Once a category is selected, another menu will be displayed with the available exercises in that category.
4. Choose the exercise you want to perform by entering the corresponding number.
5. Follow the instructions provided by the program to complete the exercise.
6. After finishing the exercise, you will return to the category menu to select another one, or you can choose **Exit** to close the program.
